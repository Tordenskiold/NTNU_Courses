			<img src="https://www3.minijuegosgratis.com/v3/games/thumbnails/20767_3.jpg" alt="Me! :D (jk just fancypants)">
			<p> 
				My coding skills include quite a bit of experience with Java, which <br>
				I have used extensively in courses like TDT4140 and TDT4240. I have <br>
				some experience with Python, as this was my language of choice <br>
				for TDT4120 and TTM4100.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Languages I am currently learning, or will be learning soon, because <br>
				they are used in different courses includes C++, JavaScript, and <br>
				HTML (I will not go into detail whether I think this is a <br>
				programming language or not :P). Languages I am looking into in my <br>
				spare time include Ruby (on Rails) and Haskell.
			</p>
			<p> 
				My expectations to this course is that I will be taught front-end <br>
				programming through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (maybe <br>
				other formats as well, but these are the ones that come to mind when <br>
				I'm thinking about web-development).

			<h2> Questions </h2>
			<ol>
				<li> The server in the client-server-architecture allows clients to <br>
				request and receive services it offers. </li>
				<li> The client provide an interface to users of the system to <br>
				request and receive services from the centralized server. </li>
				<li> An IP address is an identifier for each device connected to a <br>
				network that uses the IP (Internet Protocol) for communication. No <br>
				two devices connected to the same network may have the same IP <br>
				address. </li>
				<li> DNS (Domain Name System) is a naming system for various <br>
				resources connected to a network. It allows clients to connect to <br>
				centralized servers by using a more memorable name instead of an IP <br>
				address, because the DNS translates the domain name to the <br>
				corresponding IP address. </li>
				<li> The Internet is a global networks of networks, and the World <br>
				Wide Web is the collection of information accessible through the <br>
				Internet. </li>
				<li> HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup <br>
				language for Web pages, and describes the structure of said Web <br>
				pages. </li>
