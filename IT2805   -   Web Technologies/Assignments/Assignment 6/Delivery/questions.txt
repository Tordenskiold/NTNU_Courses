	Questions


	1 Q Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3
		evaluate to false in JavaScript?
	  A Because the floating points have to be stored in
	  	binary, 0.1 + 0.2 will give an approximation of
	  	0.3, and this is not guarranteed to be exactly 0.3.
	  	0.1 + 0.2 does not evaluate to a floating point
	  	that is clean to store in binary, and thus 0.1 +
	  	0.2 simply isn't equal to 0.3, so naturally 0.1 +
	  	0.2 === 0.3 evaluates to false.

  	2 Q What does the method attribute on a form element
  		decide?
  	  A It decides what HTTP method should be used to send
  	  	data while submitting the form.

	3 Q Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when
		the method on form element is changed to GET.
	  A After submitting the form, the GET method makes the
	  	form values visible in the address bar, while the
	  	POST method does not make these values visible.
	  	Changing to GET will thus make the form field
	  	values visible.

	4 Q Why is it considered bad practice to only validate
		form input with HTML5 and/or JavaScript?
	  A You should not rely on HTML5 and/or JavaScript for
	  	all validation. Trusting your UI and scripts may
	  	lead to potential attackers sending data for you to
	  	store server-side that is malicious. Validation
	  	server-side in addition to the useful client-side
	  	validation will be the last (and possibly also
	  	only) defence against an attacker.

	5 Q When is it appropriate to use textarea over input?
	  A It is appropriate when the user would want to write
	  	several lines of text, as input text hold on line,
	  	and textarea may have multiple lines.
